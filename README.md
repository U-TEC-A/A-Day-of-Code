Hello, there!

Welcome to COVID-19 Tracking Utilities for the Modern World project developed by U-TEC 31337!

Our team comprises of two students who are pursuing their Bachelor of Computer Engineering degree from United Technical College, Bharatpur-11, Chitwan.

Our Team:
1. Binit Ghimire <thebinitghimire@gmail.com>
2. Rupesh Aryal <rupesharyal555@gmail.com>

Our Project Files:
1. Web Application:
The index.php file is the main web application which we built for tracking the COVID-19 data worldwide. The web application obtains the IP addresses of visitors, determines the country from the obtained IP addresses and displays the COVID-19 data from their countries and the entire world as a whole. The other files in the assets directory are the web assets (images and stylesheets) of our project.

2. Command-line Utility:
To use our Command-line Utility, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer. You will also have to install different Python modules as mentioned in the requirements.txt file. Then, you can just enter the following command in any command-line window to obtain the COVID-19 tracking data:
i. Global Information: python main.py
ii.. Certain Country's Information: python main.py <country_code>
	i.e. For Nepal: python main.py np

Thank You!
